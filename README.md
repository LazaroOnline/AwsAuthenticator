## Description
This free utility helps you with 2 things:
- Using an MFA Authenticator app for Windows, so you don't need to pull out your phone each time you authenticate.
- Update in 1 click your local AWS-CLI credentials with the MFA multi-factor authentication token.  

This is useful for teams that have configured MFA security in their AWS accounts and need to update their credentials on a daily basis.
